					<div class="flex-row">I am a fullstack Javascript-leaning software engineer.
						I have experience as an individual contributor, technical team lead, and engineering manager.
						Things I like include: mission-driven organizations, inclusive teams, learning & teaching via technical mentorship, and working closely with product managers, product teams, & designers to build useful products.
						This is a manager README I wrote during my time as a engineer manager at Kink.com that reflects my managerial style at that time, and still feels generally true.
						Besides managing, the work I'm most proud of is designing and building a video transcoding publishing pipeline on top of AWS services with a custom CMS.
					</div>
					<div class="flex-row">
						My software background is considered non-traditional; I have a degree in Earth Science and worked several geology jobs before doing an intensive coding course at Hackbright Academy in 2014. 
						(Yes, I still love geology & rocks, and also had complicated experiences in and have complicated feelings about the industry.)
