# github page for personal website

This is the code for my personal github page.

STEPS I DID TO DO THIS

1. Mess around a bit and try to decide what tech I want to use and how manual I want the set-up to be.
2. Make a favicon & find a fun profile-y image (not important, fun though!)
3. Decide to use github pages (mostly out of ease & interest since I have never set a github page up before).
