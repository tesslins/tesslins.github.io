							I am an experienced engineering leader and full stack software engineer with a strong Javascript and Node.js background.
							Things I like include: mission-driven organizations, inclusive teams, learning & teaching via technical mentorship, examining & understanding complexity, and working closely with product teams to build useful products. <a href="https://github.com/tesslins/manager-readme">This</a> is a manager README I wrote during my time as a engineering manager at Kink.com that reflects my managerial thoughts at that time, and still feels generally true to who I am as both a manager and an individual contributor.
							Besides managing, the work I'm most proud of is designing and building a video transcoding publishing pipeline on top of AWS products with a custom Vue CMS.

						My software background is considered non-traditional; I have a degree in Earth Science and worked several geology jobs before doing an intensive coding course at Hackbright Academy in 2014, and have been working as a software engineer since then.
